### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, My Name is Sai Anirudh Dhanasiri. A very bored and normal comp sci student trying to survive and thrive in the digital age of the universe. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating projects that cure my boredom: Aim trainer with ability to take in custom pictures and use them as a target. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Taking classes in Machine Learning along with Prob and Stats, while learning HTML CSS and JS on the side.
- Have worked on large scale projects through the computer science classes provided at northeastern, please request access so it respects the hard work of the course faculty. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The depiction of the sun is one that was 8 minutes ago. Planets that are distant from our universe, where light potentially takes light years to reach, they still see the dinosuars roaming our planet.
