### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, My Name is Sai Anirudh Dhanasiri. A very bored and normal comp sci student trying to survive and thrive in the digital age of the universe. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating projects that cure my boredom: Space and time has always been a passion, currently working on simulating n-body physics with the help of python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Full-stack Development. Working on the frontend with Next.js and Tailwind, backend with express and also MySQL DB. 
- Have worked on large scale projects through the computer science classes provided at northeastern, please request access so it respects the hard work of the course faculty. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The depiction of the sun is one that was 8 minutes ago. Planets that are distant from our universe, where light takes a very very very .......... very long time to reach, still see the dinosuars roaming our planet.
