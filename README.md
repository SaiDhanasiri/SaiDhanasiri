### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hey, My Name is Sai Anirudh Dhanasiri. A very bored and normal comp sci student trying to survive in the digital age of the universe. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating projects that cure my boredom this summer
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Data Structures and Alogrithms (Python); Full stack development
- âš¡ Fun fact: The depiction of the sun is one that was 8 minutes ago. Planets that are distant from our universe, where light potentially takes light years to reach,
- they still see the dinosuars roaming our planet.
